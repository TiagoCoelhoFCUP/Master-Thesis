##Higher Education Institutions Social Media Content Strategies

In this dissertation we create an automatic
system capable of identifying Higher Education Institutions Twitter communication strategies
and the topics that emerge from their publication contents. Furthermore, with the current
Covid-19 pandemic causing major consequences in many different fields (political, economic,
social, educational) beyond the spread of the disease itself, we determine the impact of the
pandemic on the identified HEI content strategies. We then gage the predictive capability of the
obtained editorial models by attempting to predict the engagement and the dominant topic of a
publication. We gathered and analyzed more than 18k Twitter publications from 12 of the top
HEI according to the 2019 Center for World University Rankings (CWUR). Utilizing machine
learning techniques, and topic modeling, we determined the emergent content topics across all
HEI: Education, Faculty, Employment, Research, Health and Society. Then, we characterized
the editorial strategy of each HEI before, and during, the Covid-19 pandemic and were able to
observe significant differences between the specified periods. Lastly, with respect to the predictive
capability of the models, we determine that the information gathered is not enough to be able to
accomplish the proposed tasks
