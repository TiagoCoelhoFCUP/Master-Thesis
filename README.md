## Higher Education Institutions Social Media Content Strategies

In this dissertation we create an automatic
system capable of identifying Higher Education Institutions Twitter communication strategies and the topics that emerge from their publication contents. Furthermore, with the current Covid-19 pandemic causing major consequences in many different fields (political, economic, social, educational) beyond the spread of the disease itself, we determine the impact of the pandemic on the identified HEI content strategies. We then gage the predictive capability of the obtained editorial models by attempting to predict the engagement and the dominant topic of a publication. We gathered and analyzed more than 18k Twitter publications from 12 of the top HEI according to the 2019 Center for World University Rankings (CWUR). Utilizing machine learning techniques, and topic modeling, we determined the emergent content topics across all HEI: Education, Faculty, Employment, Research, Health and Society. Then, we characterized the editorial strategy of each HEI before, and during, the Covid-19 pandemic and were able to observe significant differences between the specified periods. Lastly, with respect to the predictive capability of the models, we determine that the information gathered is not enough to be able to accomplish the proposed tasks

Before Running
--------------
- Make sure you have Python version 3.7.4 installed.
- Make sure to write (overwriting the previous entry) the full path to the 'mallet-2.0.8' folder on your machine into the 'mallet_path.txt" file. 
- Run the following commands to install the required libraries in their correct versions: 
>>> pip install pandas
>>> pip install spacy==3.0.5
>>> pip install plotly==4.14.3
>>> pip install emoji==1.2.0
>>> pip install gensim==3.8.3
>>> pip install nltk
>>> pip install matplotlib

Run Order
----------
exp1_editorial -> exp2_editorial -> any predictive analysis script

(due to the way the notebooks were originally written, some sentiment analysis graphs are also obtained by running epx1_editorial)
(exp1_editorial generates the file df_en.csv, needed for exp2_editorial and predictive analysis)
(exp2_editorial generates the file df_en2.csv, needed for predictive analysis)
